EnglishCoach 2.0 is a web-based application designed to help users improve their English communication skills through personalized feedback on both writing and speaking. Whether you're preparing for exams like IELTS, PTE, or DET, or just aiming to enhance your fluency, this app provides detailed feedback in real-time to boost your confidence in both writing and speaking.

## Features

- **Writing Module**: Users can select a 30, 45, or 60-day writing plan with daily topics, practice writing on those topics, and receive feedback on spelling, grammar, and sentence structure.
- **Speaking Module**: Users can record their speech and get real-time feedback on pronunciation, grammar, fluency, vocabulary usage, coherence, and intonation using Groq's Whisper model for transcription.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Leverages advanced language models to provide targeted suggestions for improvement based on the user's proficiency level.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts feedback into audio for easier comprehension and engagement.
